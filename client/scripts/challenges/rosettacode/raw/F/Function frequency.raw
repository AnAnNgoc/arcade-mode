/// Display - for a program or runtime environment (whatever suits the style of your language) - the top ten most frequently occurring functions (or also identifiers or tokens, if preferred).

/// This is a static analysis: The question is not how often each function is
/// actually executed at runtime, but how often it is used by the programmer.
/// <br>
/// Besides its practical usefulness, the intent of this task is to show how to do self-inspection within the language.
