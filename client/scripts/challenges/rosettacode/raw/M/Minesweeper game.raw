/// <p class="rosetta__paragraph">There is an n by m grid that has a random number (between 10% to 20% of the total number of tiles, though older implementations may use 20%..60% instead) of randomly placed mines that need to be found.</p><br/><p class="rosetta__paragraph">Positions in the grid are modified by entering their coordinates where the first coordinate is horizontal in the grid and the second vertical. The top left of the grid is position 1,1; the bottom right is at n,m.</p><br/><ul class="rosetta__unordered-list"><li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">The total number of mines to be found is shown at the beginning of the game.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Each mine occupies a single grid point, and its position is initially unknown to the player</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">The grid is shown as a rectangle of characters between moves.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">You are initially shown all grids as obscured, by a single dot '.'</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">You may mark what you think is the position of a mine which will show as a '?'</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">You can mark what you think is free space by entering its coordinates.</li></ul><span class="rosetta__text--indented">*  If the point is free space then it is cleared, as are any adjacent points that are also free space- this is repeated recursively for subsequent adjacent free points unless that point is marked as a mine or is a mine.</span>
/// <p class="rosetta__paragraph"><span class="rosetta__text--indented">:*   Points marked as a mine show as a '?'.</span></p>
/// <p class="rosetta__paragraph"><span class="rosetta__text--indented">:*   Other free points show as an integer count of the number of adjacent true mines in its immediate neighborhood, or as a single space ' ' if the free point is not adjacent to any true mines.</span></p>
