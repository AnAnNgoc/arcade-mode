{{task}}

A <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square" title="wp: Magic_square">magic square</a> is an <span class="rosetta__text--bold">NxN</span> square matrix whose numbers consist of consecutive numbers arranged so that the sum of each row and column, <span class="rosetta__text--italic">and</span> both diagonals are equal to the same sum (which is called the <span class="rosetta__text--italic">magic number</span> or <span class="rosetta__text--italic">magic constant</span>). 

A  magic square of singly even order has a size that is a multiple of 4, plus 2 (e.g. 6, 10, 14). This means that the subsquares have an odd size, which plays a role in the construction.
