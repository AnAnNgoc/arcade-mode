For a maze generated by [[Maze generation" title="Category:Recursion]] [[Category:Puzzles]]

For a maze generated by [[Maze generation">this task</a>, write a function 
that finds (and displays) the shortest path between two cells. 
Note that because these mazes are generated by the <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Depth-first_search" title="wp: Maze_generation_algorithm#Depth-first_search">Depth-first search</a> algorithm, they contain no circular paths, 
and a simple depth-first tree search can be used.
