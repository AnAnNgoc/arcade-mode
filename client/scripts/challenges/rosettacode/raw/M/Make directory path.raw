Make directory path

{{task|File System Operations}}

;Task:
Create a directory and any missing parents.

This task is named after the posix <code>[http://www.unix.com/man-page/POSIX/0/mkdir/ mkdir -p]</code> command, and several libraries which implement the same behavior.

Please implement a function of a single path string (for example <code>./path/to/dir</code>) which has the above side-effect.
If the directory already exists, return successfully.
Ideally implementations will work equally well cross-platform (on windows, linux, and OS X).

It's likely that your language implements such a function as part of its standard library. If so, please also show how such a function would be implemented.

Simplified version of the popular [https://www.npmjs.org/package/mkdirp mkdirp library]:

<lang Javascript>var path = require('path');
var fs = require('fs');

function mkdirp (p, cb) {
    cb = cb || function () {};
    p = path.resolve(p);

    fs.mkdir(p, function (er) {
        if (!er) {
            return cb(null);
        }
        switch (er.code) {
            case 'ENOENT':
                // The directory doesn't exist. Make its parent and try again.
                mkdirp(path.dirname(p), function (er) {
                    if (er) cb(er);
                    else mkdirp(p, cb);
                });
                break;

                // In the case of any other error, something is borked.
            default:
                cb(er);
                break;
        }
    });
}</lang>
