Optional parameters

{{task|Basic language learning}}

;Task:
Define a function/method/subroutine which sorts a sequence ("table") of sequences ("rows") of strings ("cells"), by one of the strings. Besides the input to be sorted, it shall have the following optional parameters:
:{|
|
----
; ordering
: A function specifying the ordering of strings; lexicographic by default.
; column
: An integer specifying which string of each row to compare; the first by default.
; reverse
: Reverses the ordering.
----
|}

This task should be considered to include both positional and named optional parameters, as well as overloading on argument count as in Java or selector name as in Smalltalk, or, in the extreme, using different function names. Provide these variations of sorting '''in whatever way is most natural to your language'''. If the language supports both methods naturally, you are encouraged to describe both.

Do not implement a sorting algorithm; this task is about the interface. If you can't use a built-in sort routine, just omit the implementation (with a comment).

=={{header|JavaScript}}==
See [[Named parameters#JavaScript]], to pass named parameters one uses an object with properties set:
<lang javascript>function sorter(table, options) {
    opts = {}
    opts.ordering = options.ordering || 'lexicographic';
    opts.column   = options.column || 0;
    opts.reverse  = options.reverse || false;
    
    // ...
}

sorter(the_data, {reverse: true, ordering: 'numeric'});</lang>
