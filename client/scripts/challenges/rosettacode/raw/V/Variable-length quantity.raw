Variable-length quantity

{{task|Data Structures}}

Implement some operations on <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length quantity" title="wp: Variable-length quantity">variable-length quantities</a>, at least including conversions from a normal number in the language to the binary representation of the variable-length quantity for that number, and <span class="rosetta__text--italic">vice versa</span>. Any variants are acceptable.

<span class="rosetta__text--bold">Task :</span> With above operations, 
*convert these two numbers 0x200000 (2097152 in decimal) and 0x1fffff (2097151 in decimal) into sequences of octets (an eight-bit byte); 
*display these sequences of octets;
*convert these sequences of octets back to numbers, and check that they are equal to original numbers.
