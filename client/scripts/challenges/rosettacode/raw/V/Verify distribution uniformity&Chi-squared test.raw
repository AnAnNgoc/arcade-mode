Verify distribution uniformity/Chi-squared test

{{task|Probability and statistics}}
In this task, write a function to verify that a given distribution of values is uniform by using the <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson's chi-square test" title="wp: Pearson's chi-square test">$\chi^2$ test</a> to see if the distribution has a likelihood of happening of at least the significance level (conventionally 5%). The function should return a boolean that is true if the distribution is one that a uniform distribution (with appropriate number of degrees of freedom) may be expected to produce.

More information about the $\chi^2$ distribution may be found at
