Non-decimal radices/Output

{{task|Arithmetic operations}}

Programming languages often have built-in routines to convert a non-negative integer for printing in different number bases. Such common number bases might include binary, [[Octal]] and [[Hexadecimal]].


;Task:
Print a small range of integers in some different bases, as supported by standard routines of your programming language. 


;Note:
This is distinct from [[Number base conversion]] as a user-defined conversion function is <span class="rosetta__text--bold">not</span> asked for.)

The reverse operation is [[Common number base parsing]].

=={{header|JavaScript}}==
The <code><i>number</i>.toString(<i>radix</i>)</code> method produces a string representation of a number in any radix between 2 and 36.

<lang javascript>var bases = [2, 8, 10, 16, 24];
for (var n = 0; n <= 33; n++) {
    var row = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < bases.length; i++)
        row.push( n.toString(bases[i]) );
    print(row.join(', '));
}</lang>
