/// description:
///  
/// Many languages have either (or both) de-facto naming conventions or de-jure naming conventions for names used in the language and/or its libraries.  
/// These may take the form of prefixes, suffixes or a combination of upper-case and lower-case characters.  
/// Often the conventions are a bit haphazard, especially where the language and/or library has gone through a periods of evolution. (In this case: give a brief example and description).
/// <br>
/// Document as best you can (with simple examples where possible) the evolution and current status of these naming conventions. 
/// For example, name conventions for:
/// <ul class="rosetta__unordered-list"><li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Procedure and operator names.  (Intrinsic or external)</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Class, Subclass and instance names.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Built-in versus libraries names.</li></ul>
/// <br>
/// If possible, indicate where the naming conventions are implicit, explicit, mandatory or discretionary.  
/// Any tools that enforced the the naming conventions.  
/// Any cases where the naming convention as commonly violated.
/// <br>
/// If possible, indicate where the convention wased use to hint at other issues, for example the C standard library uses a prefix of "_" to "hide" raw Operating System calls from the non systems-programmer.  
/// Whereas Python embeds member functions in between "__" to make a member function "private".
