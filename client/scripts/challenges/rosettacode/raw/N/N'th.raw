N'th

{{task|Ordinal numbers}} [[Category:String manipulation]]
Write a function/method/subroutine/... that when given an integer greater than or equal to zero returns a string of the number followed by an apostrophe then the [[wp:Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal suffix]].
<br>Example returns would include <code>1'st 2'nd 3'rd 11'th 111'th 1001'st 1012'th</code>

;Task:
Use your routine to show here the output for ''at least'' the following (inclusive) ranges of integer inputs:
<code>0..25, 250..265, 1000..1025</code>

'''Note:''' apostrophes are now ''optional'' to allow correct apostrophe-less English.
