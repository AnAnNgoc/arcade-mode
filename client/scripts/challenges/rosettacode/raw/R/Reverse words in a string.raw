Reverse words in a string

{{task}}

;Task:
Reverse the order of all tokens in each of a number of strings and display the result; &nbsp; the order of characters within a token should not be modified.


;Example:
<big><big><code>Hey you, Bub! </code></big></big> &nbsp; would be shown reversed as: &nbsp; <big><big><code> Bub! you, Hey </code></big></big>


Tokens are any non-space characters separated by spaces (formally, white-space); &nbsp; the visible punctuation form part of the word within which it is located and should not be modified. 

You may assume that there are no significant non-visible characters in the input. &nbsp; Multiple or superfluous spaces may be compressed into a single space.

Some strings have no tokens, so an empty string &nbsp; (or one just containing spaces) &nbsp; would be the result.

'''Display''' the strings in order &nbsp; (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, ···), &nbsp; and one string per line. 

(You can consider the ten strings as ten lines, and the tokens as words.)

Output:
<pre>------------ Fire and Ice ----------

Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.

... last paragraph elided ...
