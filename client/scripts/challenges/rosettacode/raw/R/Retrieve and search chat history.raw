/// The Tcl Chatroom is a online chatroom. Its conversations are logged. It is useful to know if some has mentioned you or your project in the chatroom recently. You can find this out by searching the chat logs. The logs are publicly available at http://tclers.tk/conferences/tcl/. One log file corresponds to the messages from one day in <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time in Germany" title="wp: Time in Germany">Germany's current time zone</a>. Each chat log file has the name <tt>YYYY-MM-DD.tcl</tt> where <tt>YYYY</tt> is the year, <tt>MM</tt> is the month and <tt>DD</tt> the day. The logs store one message per line. The messages themselves are human-readable and their internal structure doesn't matter.
/// <br>
/// Retrieve the chat logs from the last 10 days via <a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/HTTP" title="HTTP"></a>. Find those lines that include a particular <a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/substring" title="substring"></a> and print them in the following format:
/// <br>
/// <pre><log file URL>
/// ------
/// <matching line 1>
/// <matching line 2>
/// ...
/// <matching line N>
/// ------
/// <br>
/// </pre>
/// <br>
/// The substring will be given to your program as a command line argument.
/// <br>
/// You need to account for the possible time zone difference between the client running your program and the chat log writer on the server to not miss any mentions. (For example, if you generated the log file URLs naively based on the local date, you could miss mentions if it was already April 5th for the logger but only April 4th for the client.) What this means in practice is that you should either generate the URLs in the time zone <tt>Europe/Berlin</tt> or, if your language can not do that, add an extra day (today + 1) to the range of dates you check, but then make sure to not print parts of a "not found" page by accident if a log file doesn't exist yet.
/// <br>
/// The code should be contained in a single-file script, with no "project" or "dependency" file (e.g., no <tt>requirements.txt</tt> for Python). It should only use a given programming language's standard library to accomplish this task and not rely on the user having installed any third-party packages.
/// <br>
/// If your language does not have an HTTP client in the standard library, you can speak raw HTTP 1.0 to the server. If it can't parse command line arguments in a standalone script, read the string to look for from the standard input.
