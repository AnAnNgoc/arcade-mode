'''Notes'''
*Each language typically demonstrates 1 or 2 methods of accessing the data: with web scraping (via http://www.rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Special:Categories&limit=5000), and/or with the API method (examples below for [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#AWK|Awk]], [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#Perl|Perl]], [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#Ruby|Ruby]], [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#Tcl|Tcl]], etc). The scraping and API solutions can be separate subsections, see the [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#Tcl|Tcl example]].
*Filtering wrong results is optional. You can check against [[Special:MostLinkedCategories]] (if using web scraping)
