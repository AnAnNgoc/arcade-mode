Guess the number

{{task|Games}} 
[[Category: Conditional loops]] 
[[Category:Randomness]]

;Task:
Write a program where the program chooses a number between &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''10'''. 

A player is then prompted to enter a guess. &nbsp; If the player guesses wrong, &nbsp; then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct. 

When the player has made a successful guess the computer will issue a &nbsp; "Well guessed!" &nbsp; message, &nbsp; and the program exits.

A &nbsp; [[:Category:Conditional loops|conditional loop]] &nbsp; may be used to repeat the guessing until the user is correct.
