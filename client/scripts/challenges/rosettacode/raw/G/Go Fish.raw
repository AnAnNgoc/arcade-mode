/// Write a program to let the user play <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go Fish" title="wp: Go Fish">Go Fish</a> against a computer opponent. Use the following rules:
/// <br>
/// <ul class="rosetta__unordered-list">
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item">Each player is dealt nine cards to start with.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item">On their turn, a player asks their opponent for a given rank (such as threes or kings). A player must already have at least one card of a given rank to ask for more.</li>
/// <br>
/// </ul>** If the opponent has any cards of the named rank, they must hand over all such cards, and the requester can ask again.
/// ** If the opponent has no cards of the named rank, the requester draws a card and ends their turn.
/// <ul class="rosetta__unordered-list">
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item">A <span class="rosetta__text--italic">book</span> is a collection of every card of a given rank. Whenever a player completes a book, they may remove it from their hand.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item">If at any time a player's hand is empty, they may immediately draw a new card, so long as any new cards remain in the deck.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item">The game ends when every book is complete. The player with the most books wins.</li>
/// <br>
/// </ul>
/// The game's AI need not be terribly smart, but it should use at least some strategy. That is, it shouldn't choose legal moves entirely at random.
