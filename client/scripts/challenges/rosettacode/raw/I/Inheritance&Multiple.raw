Multiple inheritance allows to specify that one [[classes " title="Category:Object oriented]] [[Category:Type System]]
Multiple inheritance allows to specify that one [[classes "> class</a> is a subclass of several other classes. 
Some languages allow multiple [[inheritance]] for arbitrary classes, 
others restrict it to interfaces, some don't allow it at all.

Write two classes (or interfaces) <tt>Camera</tt> and <tt>MobilePhone</tt>, 
then write a class <tt>CameraPhone</tt> which is both a <tt>Camera</tt> and 
a <tt>MobilePhone</tt>.

There is no need to implement any functions for those classes.
