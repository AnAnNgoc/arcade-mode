Get two integers from the user.

Then, &nbsp; display a message if the first integer is:
::::* &nbsp; less than, 
::::* &nbsp; equal to, &nbsp; or 
::::* &nbsp; greater than
the second integer. 


Test the condition &nbsp; <span class="rosetta__text--italic">for each case separately</span>, &nbsp; so that &nbsp; <span class="rosetta__text--italic">all three comparison operators are used</span> &nbsp; in the code.

<lang javascript>
// Using type coercion
function compare(a, b) {
  if (a==b) print(a + " equals " + b);
  if (a < b) print(a + " is less than " + b);
  if (a > b) print(a + " is greater than " + b);

// Without using type coercion and using standards
// Written for browsers
// assumption of a and b are both integers if typeof test passes

  if (typeof a === typeof b) {
    if (a === b) {
      document.writeln(a + " equals " + b);
    }

      document.writeln(a + " is less than " + b);
    }
    if (a > b) {
      document.writeln(a + " is greater than " + b);
    }
  } else {
    // "1" and 1 are an example of this as the first is type string and the second is type number
    print(a + "{" + (typeof a) + "} and " + b + "{" + (typeof b) + "} are not of the same type and cannot be compared.");
