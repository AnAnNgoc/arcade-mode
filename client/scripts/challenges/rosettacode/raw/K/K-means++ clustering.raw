It is identical to the [[WP:K-means_clustering|K-means]] algorithm, except for the selection of initial conditions.  [[Image:CircleClusters.png|thumb|right|alt=A circular distribution of data partitioned into 7 colored clusters; similar to the top of a beach ball|This data was partitioned into 7 clusters using the [[WP:K-means_clustering|K-means algorithm]].</a>

/// The task is to <span class="rosetta__text--bold"><span class="rosetta__text--italic">implement the K-means++ algorithm</span></span>.  Produce a function which takes two arguments: the number of clusters K, and the dataset to classify.  K is a positive integer and the dataset is a list of points in the Cartesian plane.  The output is a list of clusters (related sets of points, according to the algorithm).

/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--ordered">Provide a function to exercise your code, which generates a list of random points.</li>

/// Extra credit is only awarded if the examples given demonstrate the feature in question. To earn credit for 1. and 2., visualize 6 clusters of 30,000 points in ℝ<sup>2</sup>.  It is not necessary to provide visualization for spaces higher than ℝ<sup>2</sup> but the examples should demonstrate features 3. and 4. if the solution has them.
