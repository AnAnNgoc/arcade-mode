Jump anywhere

[[Imperative programming" title="Category:Branches]] [[Category:Simple]]
[[Imperative programming">Imperative programs</a> like to jump around, but some languages restrict these jumps. Many structured languages restrict their [[conditional structures]] and [[loops]] to <span class="rosetta__text--italic">local jumps</span> within a function. Some assembly languages limit certain jumps or branches to a small range.

This task is demonstrate a local jump and a global jump and the various other types of jumps that the language supports. 
For the purpose of this task, the jumps need not be used for a single purpose and you have the freedom to use these jumps for different purposes. 
You may also defer to more specific tasks, like [[Exceptions]] or [[Generator]]. 
This task provides a "grab bag" for several types of jumps. There are <span class="rosetta__text--italic">non-local jumps</span> across function calls, or <span class="rosetta__text--italic">long jumps</span> to anywhere within a program. Anywhere means not only to the tops of functions!

* Some languages can <span class="rosetta__text--italic">go to</span> any global label in a program.
* Some languages can break multiple function calls, also known as <span class="rosetta__text--italic">unwinding the call stack</span>.
* Some languages can save a <span class="rosetta__text--italic">continuation</span>. The program can later continue from the same place. So you can jump anywhere, but only if you have a previous visit there (to save the continuation).

<br>These jumps are not all alike. 
A simple <span class="rosetta__text--italic">goto</span> never touches the call stack. 
A continuation saves the call stack, so you can continue a function call after it ends.


;Task:
Use your language to demonstrate the various types of jumps that it supports. 

Because the possibilities vary by language, this task is not specific. 
You have the freedom to use these jumps for different purposes. 
You may also defer to more specific tasks, like [[Exceptions]] or [[Generator]].
