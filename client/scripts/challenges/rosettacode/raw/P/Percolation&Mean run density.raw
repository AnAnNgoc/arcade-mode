Percolation/Mean run density

{{task|Percolation Simulations}}{{Percolation Simulation}}
Let $v$ be a vector of $n$ values of either <tt>1</tt> or <tt>0</tt> where the probability of any 
value being <tt>1</tt> is $p$; the probability of a value being <tt>0</tt> is therefore $1-p$. 
Define a run of <tt>1</tt>s as being a group of consecutive <tt>1</tt>s in the vector bounded 
either by the limits of the vector or by a <tt>0</tt>. Let the number of such runs in a given
vector of length $n$ be $R_n$.

For example, the following vector has $R_{10} = 3$

Percolation theory states that 

:$K(p) = \lim_{n\to\infty} R_n / n = p(1 - p)$

;Task

Any calculation of $R_n / n$ for finite $n$ is subject to randomness so should be 
computed as the average of $t$ runs, where $t \ge 100$.

For values of $p$ of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9, show the effect of varying $n$
on the accuracy of simulated $K(p)$.
