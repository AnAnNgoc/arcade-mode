/// The &nbsp; <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig (dice)" title="wp: Pig (dice)">game of Pig</a> &nbsp; is a multiplayer game played with a single six-sided die. &nbsp; The
/// object of the game is to reach &nbsp; <span class="rosetta__text--bold">100</span> &nbsp; points or more. &nbsp; 
/// Play is taken in turns. &nbsp; On each person's turn that person has the option of either:
/// <br>
/// <span class="rosetta__text--indented"># <span class="rosetta__text--bold">Rolling the dice</span>: &nbsp; where a roll of two to six is added to their score for that turn and the player's turn continues as the player is given the same choice again; &nbsp; or a roll of &nbsp; <span class="rosetta__text--bold">1</span> &nbsp; loses the player's total points &nbsp; <span class="rosetta__text--italic">for that turn</span> &nbsp; and their turn finishes with play passing to the next player.</span>
/// <span class="rosetta__text--indented"># <span class="rosetta__text--bold">Holding</span>: &nbsp; the player's score for that round is added to their total and becomes safe from the effects of throwing a &nbsp; <span class="rosetta__text--bold">1</span> &nbsp; (one). &nbsp; The player's turn finishes with play passing to the next player.</span>
