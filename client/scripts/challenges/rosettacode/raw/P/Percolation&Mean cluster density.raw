Percolation/Mean cluster density

{{task|Percolation Simulations}}{{Percolation Simulation}}
Let $c$ be a 2D boolean square matrix of $n \times n$ values of either <tt>1</tt> or <tt>0</tt> where the 
probability of any value being <tt>1</tt> is $p$, (and of <tt>0</tt> is therefore $1-p$). 
We define a <span class="rosetta__text--italic">cluster</span> of <tt>1</tt>'s as being a group of <tt>1</tt>'s connected vertically or
horizontally (i.e., using the <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von Neumann neighborhood" title="wp: Von Neumann neighborhood">Von Neumann neighborhood rule</a>) and bounded by either $0$ or by the limits of the matrix.
Let the number of such clusters in such a randomly constructed matrix be $C_n$.

Percolation theory states that $K(p)$ (the mean cluster density) will satisfy $K(p) = C_n / n^2$ as $n$ tends to infinity. For $p = 0.5$, $K(p)$ is found numerically to approximate $0.065770$...

;Task

Show the effect of varying $n$ on the accuracy of simulated $K(p)$ for $p = 0.5$ and 
for values of $n$ up to at least $1000$.
Any calculation of $C_n$ for finite $n$ is subject to randomness, so an approximation should be 
computed as the average of $t$ runs, where $t$ &ge; $5$.

For extra credit, graphically show clusters in a $15\times 15$, $p=0.5$ grid.
