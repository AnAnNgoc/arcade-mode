Permutations by swapping

{{task}}

;Task:
Generate permutations of n items in which successive permutations differ from each other by the swapping of any two items. 

Also generate the sign of the permutation which is +1 when the permutation is generated from an even number of swaps from the initial state, and -1 for odd. 

Show the permutations and signs of three items, in order of generation <span class="rosetta__text--italic">here</span>.

Such data are of use in generating the <a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Matrix arithmetic" title="Matrix arithmetic">determinant</a> of a square matrix and any functions created should bear this in mind.

Note: The Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm generates successive permutations where <span class="rosetta__text--italic">adjacent</span> items are swapped, but from <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_a_permutation#Example" title="wp: Parity_of_a_permutation#Example">this</a> discussion adjacency is not a requirement.
