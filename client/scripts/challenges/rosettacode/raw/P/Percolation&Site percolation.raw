/// Given an $M \times N$ rectangular array of cells numbered $\mathrm{cell}[0..M-1, 0..N-1]$assume $M$ is horizontal and $N$ is downwards. 
/// <br>
/// Assume that the probability of any cell being filled is a constant $p$ where

/// <br>
/// <dl class="rosetta__description-list"><dt class="rosetta__description-title">The task:</dt></dl>
/// Simulate creating the array of cells with probability $p$ and then 
/// testing if there is a route through adjacent filled cells from any on row $0$ to any on row $N$, i.e. testing for site percolation.
/// <br>
/// Given $p$ repeat the percolation $t$ times to estimate the proportion of times that the fluid can percolate to the bottom for any given $p$.
/// <br>
/// Show how the probability of percolating through the random grid changes with $p$ going from $0.0$ to $1.0$ in $0.1$ increments and with the number of repetitions to estimate the fraction at any given $p$ as $t >= 100$.
