Percolation/Site percolation

{{task|Percolation Simulations}}{{Percolation Simulation}}
Given an $M \times N$ rectangular array of cells numbered $\mathrm{cell}[0..M-1, 0..N-1]$assume $M$ is horizontal and $N$ is downwards. 

Assume that the probability of any cell being filled is a constant $p$ where
: $0.0 \le p \le 1.0$

;The task:
Simulate creating the array of cells with probability $p$ and then 
testing if there is a route through adjacent filled cells from any on row $0$ to any on row $N$, i.e. testing for site percolation.

Given $p$ repeat the percolation $t$ times to estimate the proportion of times that the fluid can percolate to the bottom for any given $p$.

Show how the probability of percolating through the random grid changes with $p$ going from $0.0$ to $1.0$ in $0.1$ increments and with the number of repetitions to estimate the fraction at any given $p$ as $t >= 100$.

Use an $M=15, N=15$ grid of cells for all cases.

Optionally depict a percolation through a cell grid graphically.
