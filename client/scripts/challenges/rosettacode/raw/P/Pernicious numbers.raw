Pernicious numbers

{{task|Prime Numbers}}
A <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernicious number" title="wp: Pernicious number">pernicious number]] is a positive integer whose <a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/population count</a> is a prime. The population count is the number of ones in the binary representation of a non-negative integer. 


;Example
22 (which is 10110 in binary) has a population count of 3, which is prime, and therefore 22 is a pernicious number.


;Task
* display the first 25 pernicious numbers.
* display all pernicious numbers between 888,888,877 and 888,888,888 (inclusive).
* display each list of integers on one line (which may or may not include a title).
