Sokoban

{{task|Games}}
Demonstrate how to find a solution to a given <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban" title="wp: Sokoban">Sokoban</a> level. For the purpose of this task (formally, a PSPACE-complete problem) any method may be used. However a move-optimal or push-optimal (or any other -optimal) solutions is preferred.

Sokoban levels are usually stored as a character array where
* <span class="rosetta__text--italic">space</span> is an empty square
* # is a wall
* @ is the player
* $ is a box
* . is a goal
* + is the player on a goal
* * is a box on a goal

Sokoban solutions are usually stored in the LURD format, where lowercase l, u, r and d represent a move in that (<span class="rosetta__text--bold">l</span>eft, <span class="rosetta__text--bold">u</span>p, <span class="rosetta__text--bold">r</span>ight, <span class="rosetta__text--bold">d</span>own) direction and capital LURD represents a push.

Please state if you use some other format for either the input or output, and why.
