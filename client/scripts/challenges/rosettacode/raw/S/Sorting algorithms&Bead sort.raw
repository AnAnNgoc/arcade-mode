;Task:
Sort an array of positive integers using the <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead_sort" title="wp: Bead_sort">Bead Sort Algorithm</a>. 

A &nbsp; <span class="rosetta__text--italic">bead sort</span> &nbsp; is also known as a &nbsp; <span class="rosetta__text--italic">gravity sort</span>.


Algorithm has &nbsp; O(S), &nbsp; where &nbsp; S &nbsp; is the sum of the integers in the input set: &nbsp; Each bead is moved individually. 

This is the case when bead sort is implemented without a mechanism to assist in finding empty spaces below the beads, such as in software implementations.
