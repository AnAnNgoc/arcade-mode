Substring/Top and tail

{{task}}[[Category:String manipulation]]
The task is to demonstrate how to remove the first and last characters from a string. 

The solution should demonstrate how to obtain the following results:

* String with first character removed
* String with last character removed
* String with both the first and last characters removed

If the program uses UTF-8 or UTF-16, it must work on any valid Unicode code point, whether in the Basic Multilingual Plane or above it. 

The program must reference logical characters (code points), not 8-bit code units for UTF-8 or 16-bit code units for UTF-16. 

Programs for other encodings (such as 8-bit ASCII, or EUC-JP) are not required to handle all Unicode characters.

<lang javascript>alert("knight".slice(1));       // strip first character
alert("socks".slice(0, -1));    // strip last character
alert("brooms".slice(1, -1));   // strip both first and last characters</lang>
