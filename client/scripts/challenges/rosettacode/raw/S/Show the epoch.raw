Show the epoch

{{task}}

;Task: 
Choose popular date libraries used by your language and show the &nbsp; <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(reference_date)#Computing" title="wp: Epoch_(reference_date)#Computing">epoch</a> &nbsp; those libraries use. 

A demonstration is preferable &nbsp; (e.g. setting the internal representation of the date to 0 ms/ns/etc., &nbsp; or another way that will still show the epoch even if it is changed behind the scenes by the implementers), &nbsp; but text from (with links to) documentation is also acceptable where a demonstration is impossible/impractical. 

For consistency's sake, show the date in UTC time where possible.
