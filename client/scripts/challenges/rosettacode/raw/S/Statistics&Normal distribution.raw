Statistics/Normal distribution

{{task}}
The <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal distribution" title="wp: Normal distribution">Normal]] (or Gaussian) distribution is a frequently used distribution in statistics. While most programming languages provide a uniformly distributed random number generator, one can [[wp:Normal distribution#Generating_values_from_normal_distribution|derive</a> normally distributed random numbers from a uniform generator.


;The task:
# Take a uniform random number generator and create a large (you decide how large) set of numbers that follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution.  Calculate the dataset's mean and stddev, and show the histogram here.
# Mention any native language support for the generation of normally distributed random numbers.
