/// description:

/// <br>
/// For this task, the Stern-Brocot sequence is to be generated by an algorithm similar to that employed in generating the [[Fibonacci sequence]].
/// <br>
/// # The first and second members of the sequence are both 1:
/// #* &nbsp; &nbsp; 1, 1
/// # Start by considering the second member of the sequence
/// # Sum the considered member of the sequence and its precedent, (1 + 1) = 2, and append it to the end of the sequence:
/// #* &nbsp; &nbsp; 1, 1, 2
/// # Append the considered member of the sequence to the end of the sequence:
/// #* &nbsp; &nbsp; 1, 1, 2, 1
/// # Consider the next member of the series, (the third member i.e. 2)
/// # GOTO 3 
/// #*         
/// #* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ─── Expanding another loop we get: ───

/// # Sum the considered member of the sequence and its precedent, (2 + 1) = 3, and append it to the end of the sequence:
