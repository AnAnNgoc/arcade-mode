Stable marriage problem

Solve the <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable marriage problem" title="wp: Stable marriage problem">Stable marriage problem</a> using the Gale/Shapley algorithm.


<span class="rosetta__text--bold">Problem description</span><br>
Given an equal number of men and women to be paired for marriage, each man ranks all the women in order of his preference and each woman ranks all the men in order of her preference. 

A stable set of engagements for marriage is one where no man prefers a woman over the one he is engaged to, where that other woman <span class="rosetta__text--italic">also</span> prefers that man over the one she is engaged to. I.e. with consulting marriages, there would be no reason for the engagements between the people to change.

Gale and Shapley proved that there is a stable set of engagements for any set of preferences and the first link above gives their algorithm for finding a set of stable engagements.


<span class="rosetta__text--bold">Task Specifics</span><br>
Given ten males:
    abe, bob, col, dan, ed, fred, gav, hal, ian, jon
And ten females:
    abi, bea, cath, dee, eve, fay, gay, hope, ivy, jan

And a complete list of ranked preferences, where the most liked is to the left:
   abe: abi, eve, cath, ivy, jan, dee, fay, bea, hope, gay
   bob: cath, hope, abi, dee, eve, fay, bea, jan, ivy, gay
   col: hope, eve, abi, dee, bea, fay, ivy, gay, cath, jan
   dan: ivy, fay, dee, gay, hope, eve, jan, bea, cath, abi
    ed: jan, dee, bea, cath, fay, eve, abi, ivy, hope, gay
  fred: bea, abi, dee, gay, eve, ivy, cath, jan, hope, fay
   gav: gay, eve, ivy, bea, cath, abi, dee, hope, jan, fay
   hal: abi, eve, hope, fay, ivy, cath, jan, bea, gay, dee
   ian: hope, cath, dee, gay, bea, abi, fay, ivy, jan, eve
   jon: abi, fay, jan, gay, eve, bea, dee, cath, ivy, hope
    
   abi: bob, fred, jon, gav, ian, abe, dan, ed, col, hal
   bea: bob, abe, col, fred, gav, dan, ian, ed, jon, hal
  cath: fred, bob, ed, gav, hal, col, ian, abe, dan, jon
   dee: fred, jon, col, abe, ian, hal, gav, dan, bob, ed
   eve: jon, hal, fred, dan, abe, gav, col, ed, ian, bob
   fay: bob, abe, ed, ian, jon, dan, fred, gav, col, hal
   gay: jon, gav, hal, fred, bob, abe, col, ed, dan, ian
  hope: gav, jon, bob, abe, ian, dan, hal, ed, col, fred
   ivy: ian, col, hal, gav, fred, bob, abe, ed, jon, dan
   jan: ed, hal, gav, abe, bob, jon, col, ian, fred, dan

# Use the Gale Shapley algorithm to find a stable set of engagements
# Perturb this set of engagements to form an unstable set of engagements then check this new set for stability.
