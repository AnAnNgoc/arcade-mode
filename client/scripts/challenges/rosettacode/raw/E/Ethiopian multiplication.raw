Ethiopian multiplication

{{task|Arithmetic operations}}
Ethiopian multiplication is a method of multiplying integers using only addition, doubling, and halving.


<span class="rosetta__text--bold">Method:</span> <br>
# Take two numbers to be multiplied and write them down at the top of two columns.
# In the left-hand column repeatedly halve the last number, discarding any remainders, and write the result below the last in the same column, until you write a value of 1.
# In the right-hand column repeatedly double the last number and write the result below. stop when you add a result in the same row as where the left hand column shows 1.
# Examine the table produced and discard any row where the value in the left column is even.
# Sum the values in the right-hand column that remain to produce the result of multiplying the original two numbers together

<br>
<span class="rosetta__text--bold">For example:</span> &nbsp; 17 &times; 34
        17    34
Halving the first column:
        17    34
         8
         4
         2
         1
Doubling the second column:
        17    34
         8    68
         4   136 
         2   272
         1   544
Strike-out rows whose first cell is even:
        17    34
         8    <strike>68</strike> 
         4   <strike>136</strike> 
         2   <strike>272</strike> 
         1   544
Sum the remaining numbers in the right-hand column:
        17    34
         8    -- 
         4   --- 
         2   --- 
         1   544
            ====
             578
So 17 multiplied by 34, by the Ethiopian method is 578.


;Task:
The task is to <span class="rosetta__text--bold">define three named functions</span>/methods/procedures/subroutines:
# one to <span class="rosetta__text--bold">halve an integer</span>,
# one to <span class="rosetta__text--bold">double an integer</span>, and
# one to <span class="rosetta__text--bold">state if an integer is even</span>.

<br>
Use these functions to <span class="rosetta__text--bold">create a function that does Ethiopian multiplication</span>.
