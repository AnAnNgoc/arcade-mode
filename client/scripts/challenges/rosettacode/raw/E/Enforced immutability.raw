=={{header|JavaScript}}==
You can create constants with the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const Mozilla-specific extension const]. This is not supported by IE and it only works on simple scalars and not on arrays, objects, or parameters.

'''Update''': const is now a standard part of ES6 JavaScript, and works with all data types, including arrays, objects, and parameters. It is not, however, included in the ES5 standard.
<lang javascript>const pi = 3.1415;
const msg = "Hello World";</lang>
