Exponentiation order

{{task}}

This task will demonstrate the order of [[wp:Exponentiation|exponentiation]] &nbsp; <big>('''x<sup>y</sup>''') </big> &nbsp; when there are multiple exponents.

(Many programming languages, especially those with extended-precision integer arithmetic, usually support one of <code>**</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>â†‘</code> or some such for exponentiation.)


;Task requirements
Show the result of a language's evaluation of multiple exponentiation (either as an integer or floating point).

If your language's exponentiation operator is not one of the usual ones, please comment on how to recognize it.


Using whatever operator or syntax your language supports (if any), show the results in three lines (with identification):
<big>  
::::* &nbsp; 5**3**2 
::::* &nbsp; (5**3)**2
::::* &nbsp; 5**(3**2)
</big>

<br>
If there are other methods (or formats) of multiple exponentiations, show them as well.
