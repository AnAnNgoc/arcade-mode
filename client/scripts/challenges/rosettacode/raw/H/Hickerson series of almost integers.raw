/// description:
/// <br>
/// The following function, due to D Hickerson, is said to generate "Almost integers" by the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlmostInteger.html "Almost Integer" page of Wolfram Mathworld]. (December 31 2013).
/// <br>
/// The function is:
/// <br>
/// <span class="rosetta__text--indented">$h(n) = {\operatorname{n}!\over2(\ln{2})^{n+1}}$</span>
/// <br>
/// It is said to produce "almost integers" for n between 1 and 17.  
/// The purpose of the task is to verify this assertion.
/// <br>
/// Assume that an "almost integer" has <span class="rosetta__text--bold">either a nine or a zero as its first digit after the decimal point</span> of its decimal string representation
/// <br>
/// The task is to calculate all values of the function checking and stating which are "almost integers".
/// <br>
/// Note: Use extended/arbitrary precision numbers in your calculation if necessary to ensure you have adequate precision of results as for example:
///     h(18) = 3385534663256845326.39...
/// <br>
/// <br>

/// challengeSeed:
function replaceMe (foo) {
  // Good luck!
  return true;
}

/// solutions:


/// rawSolutions:

/// tail:
const replaceThis = 3;

/// tests:
assert(typeof replaceMe === 'function', 'message: <code>replaceMe</code> is a function.');
