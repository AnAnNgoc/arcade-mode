Hickerson series of almost integers

{{task}}
The following function, due to D Hickerson, is said to generate "Almost integers" by the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlmostInteger.html "Almost Integer" page of Wolfram Mathworld]. (December 31 2013).

The function is:

:$h(n) = {\operatorname{n}!\over2(\ln{2})^{n+1}}$

It is said to produce "almost integers" for n between 1 and 17.  
The purpose of the task is to verify this assertion.

Assume that an "almost integer" has <span class="rosetta__text--bold">either a nine or a zero as its first digit after the decimal point</span> of its decimal string representation

The task is to calculate all values of the function checking and stating which are "almost integers".

Note: Use extended/arbitrary precision numbers in your calculation if necessary to ensure you have adequate precision of results as for example:
    h(18) = 3385534663256845326.39...
