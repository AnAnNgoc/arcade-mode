/// <p class="rosetta__paragraph">Implement the <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough transform" title="wp: Hough transform">Hough transform</a>, which is used as part of feature extraction with digital images.</p><br/><p class="rosetta__paragraph">It is a tool that makes it far easier to identify straight lines in the source image, whatever their orientation.</p><br/><p class="rosetta__paragraph">The transform maps each point in the target image, $(\rho,\theta)$, to the average color of the pixels on the corresponding line of the source image (in $(x,y)$-space, where the line corresponds to points of the form $x\cos\theta + y\sin\theta = \rho$). The idea is that where there is a straight line in the original image, it corresponds to a bright (or dark, depending on the color of the background field) spot; by applying a suitable filter to the results of the transform, it is possible to extract the locations of the lines in the original image.</p><br/><p class="rosetta__paragraph"><a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Image:Pentagon.png" title="Image:Pentagon.png">thumb|Sample PNG image to use for the Hough transform.</a></p>
/// <p class="rosetta__paragraph">The target space actually uses polar coordinates, but is conventionally plotted on rectangular coordinates for display. There's no specification of exactly how to map polar coordinates to a flat surface for display, but a convenient method is to use one axis for $\theta$ and the other for $\rho$, with the center of the source image being the origin.</p><br/><p class="rosetta__paragraph">There is also a spherical Hough transform, which is more suited to identifying planes in 3D data.</p>
