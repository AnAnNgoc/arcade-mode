;Task:
Cause a line printer attached to the computer to print a line containing the message: &nbsp; <big><code> Hello World! </code></big>


;Note:
A line printer is not the same as standard output. 

A &nbsp; [[wp:line printer|line printer]] &nbsp; was an older-style printer which prints one line at a time to a continuous ream of paper. 

With some systems, a line printer can be any device attached to an appropriate port (such as a parallel port).
