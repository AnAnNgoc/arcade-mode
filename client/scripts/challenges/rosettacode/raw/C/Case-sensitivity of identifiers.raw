/// Three dogs (Are there three dogs or one dog?) is a code snippet used to illustrate the lettercase sensitivity of the programming language. For a case-sensitive language, the identifiers dog, Dog and DOG are all different and we should get the output:
/// <pre>
/// The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.
/// </pre>
/// For a language that is lettercase insensitive, we get the following output:
/// <pre>
/// There is just one dog named Bernie.
