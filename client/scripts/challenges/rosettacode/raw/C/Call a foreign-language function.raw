Call a foreign-language function

{{task|Programming environment operations}}

;Task:
Show how a <a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Foreign function interface" title="Foreign function interface">foreign language function</a> can be called from the language.


As an example, consider calling functions defined in the [[C]] language. Create a string containing "Hello World!" of the string type typical to the language. Pass the string content to [[C]]'s <code>strdup</code>. The content can be copied if necessary. Get the result from <code>strdup</code> and print it using language means. Do not forget to free the result of <code>strdup</code> (allocated in the heap).


;Notes:
* It is not mandated if the [[C]] run-time library is to be loaded statically or dynamically. You are free to use either way.
* [[C++]] and [[C]] solutions can take some other language to communicate with.
* It is <span class="rosetta__text--italic">not</span> mandatory to use <code>strdup</code>, especially if the foreign function interface being demonstrated makes that uninformative.
