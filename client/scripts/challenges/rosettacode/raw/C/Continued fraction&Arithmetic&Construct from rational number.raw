Continued fraction/Arithmetic/Construct from rational number

{{task}}To understand this task in context please see [[Continued fraction arithmetic]]

The purpose of this task is to write a function $\mathit{r2cf}(\mathrm{int}$ $N_1, \mathrm{int}$ $N_2)$, or $\mathit{r2cf}(\mathrm{Fraction}$ $N)$, which will output a continued fraction assuming:
:$N_1$ is the numerator
:$N_2$ is the denominator
  
The function should output its results one digit at a time each time it is called, in a manner sometimes described as lazy evaluation.

To achieve this it must determine: the integer part; and remainder part, of $N_1$ divided by $N_2$. It then sets $N_1$ to $N_2$ and $N_2$ to the determined remainder part. It then outputs the determined integer part. It does this until $\mathrm{abs}(N_2)$ is zero.

Demonstrate the function by outputing the continued fraction for:
: 1/2
: 3
: 23/8
: 13/11
: 22/7
: -151/77
$\sqrt 2$ should approach $[1; 2, 2, 2, 2, \ldots]$ try ever closer rational approximations until boredom gets the better of you:
: 14142,10000
: 141421,100000
: 1414214,1000000
: 14142136,10000000

Try :
: 31,10
: 314,100
: 3142,1000
: 31428,10000
: 314285,100000
: 3142857,1000000
: 31428571,10000000
: 314285714,100000000

Observe how this rational number behaves differently to $\sqrt 2$ and convince yourself that, in the same way as $3.7$ may be represented as $3.70$ when an extra decimal place is required, $[3;7]$ may be represented as $[3;7,\infty]$ when an extra term is required.
