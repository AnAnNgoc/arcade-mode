Continued fraction

{{task}}A number may be represented as a <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued fraction" title="wp: Continued fraction">continued fraction</a> (see [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuedFraction.html Mathworld] for more information) as follows:

:$a_0 + \cfrac{b_1}{a_1 + \cfrac{b_2}{a_2 + \cfrac{b_3}{a_3 + \ddots}}}$

The task is to write a program which generates such a number and prints a real representation of it. The code should be tested by calculating and printing the square root of 2, Napier's Constant, and Pi, using the following coefficients:

For the square root of 2, use $a_0 = 1$ then $a_N = 2$. $b_N$ is always $1$.

:$\sqrt{2} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \ddots}}}$

For Napier's Constant, use $a_0 = 2$, then $a_N = N$. $b_1 = 1$ then $b_N = N-1$.

:$e = 2 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{2}{3 + \cfrac{3}{4 + \ddots}}}}$

For Pi, use $a_0 = 3$ then $a_N = 6$. $b_N = (2N-1)^2$.

:$\pi = 3 + \cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{9}{6 + \cfrac{25}{6 + \ddots}}}$
