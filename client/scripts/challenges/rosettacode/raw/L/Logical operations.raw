;Task:
Write a function that takes two logical (boolean) values, and outputs the result of "and" and "or" on both arguments as well as "not" on the first arguments. 

If the programming language doesn't provide a separate type for logical values, use the type most commonly used for that purpose.

If the language supports additional logical operations on booleans such as XOR, list them as well.

  print("a OR b: " + (a || b));
  print("NOT a: " + (!a));
