JavaScript is no longer used only in environments which are carefully isolated from file systems, but JavaScript standards still do not specify standard file-system functions. 
Leaving aside the particular and variable details of how files will be opened and read in environments like Node.js and OS X JavaScript for Automation etc., 
we can still use core JavasScript (ES5 in the example below), to count the characters in a text once it has been read from a file system.

<lang JavaScript>(function(txt) {

    var cs = txt.split(''),
        i = cs.length,
        dct =  {},
        c = '',
        keys;
        
    while (i--) {
        c = cs[i];
        dct[c] = (dct[c] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    keys = Object.keys(dct);
    keys.sort();
    return keys.map(function (c) { return [c, dct[c]]; });
