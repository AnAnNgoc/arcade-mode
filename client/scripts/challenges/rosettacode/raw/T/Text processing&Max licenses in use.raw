Text processing/Max licenses in use

{{task|Text processing}}

A company currently pays a fixed sum for the use of a particular licensed software package. &nbsp; In determining if it has a good deal it decides to calculate its maximum use of the software from its license management log file.

Assume the software's licensing daemon faithfully records a checkout event when a copy of the software starts and a checkin event when the software finishes to its log file. 

An example of  checkout and  checkin events are:
  License OUT @ 2008/10/03_23:51:05 for job 4974
  ...
  License IN  @ 2008/10/04_00:18:22 for job 4974


;Task:
Save the 10,000 line log file from &nbsp; [http://rosettacode.org/resources/mlijobs.txt <big> here</big>] &nbsp; into a local file, then write a program to scan the file extracting both the maximum licenses that were out at any time, and the time(s) at which this occurs.

    var line = fh.readline();
    if (line.substr(8,3) == "OUT") {
        in_use++;
        if (in_use > max_in_use) {
            max_in_use = in_use;
            max_in_use_at = [ line.split(' ')[3] ];
        }
        else if (in_use == max_in_use)
            max_in_use_at.push( line.split(' ')[3] );
    }
    else if (line.substr(8,2) == "IN") 
        in_use--;
}

fh.close();

WScript.echo("Max licenses out: " + max_in_use + "\n  " + max_in_use_at.join('\n  '));</lang>

output: 
<pre>Max licenses out: 99
  2008/10/03_08:39:34
  2008/10/03_08:40:40</pre>
