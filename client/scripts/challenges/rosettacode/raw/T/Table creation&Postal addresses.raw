/// You may assume that all the addresses to be stored will be located in the USA. &nbsp; As such, you will need (in addition to a field holding a unique identifier) a field holding the street address, a field holding the city, a field holding the state code, and a field holding the zipcode. &nbsp; Choose appropriate types for each field.

/// For non-database languages, show how you would open a connection to a database (your choice of which) and create an address table in it. You should follow the existing models here for how you would structure the table.
