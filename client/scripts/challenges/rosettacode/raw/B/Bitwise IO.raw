/// description:
/// <br>
/// The aim of this task is to write functions (or create a class if your
/// language is Object Oriented and you prefer) for reading and writing sequences of
/// bits. While the output of a <tt>asciiprint "STRING"</tt> is the ASCII byte sequence
/// "S", "T", "R", "I", "N", "G", the output of a "print" of the bits sequence
/// 0101011101010 (13 bits) must be 0101011101010; real I/O is performed always
/// <span class="rosetta__text--italic">quantized</span> by byte (avoiding endianness issues and relying on underlying
/// buffering for performance), therefore you must obtain as output the bytes
/// 0101 0111 0101 0<span class="rosetta__text--bold">000</span> (bold bits are padding bits), i.e. in hexadecimal 57 50.
/// <br>
/// As test, you can implement a <span class="rosetta__text--bold">rough</span> (e.g. don't care about error handling or
/// other issues) compression/decompression program for ASCII sequences
/// of bytes, i.e. bytes for which the most significant bit is always unused, so that you can write
/// seven bits instead of eight (each 8 bytes of input, we write 7 bytes of output).
/// <br>
/// These bit oriented I/O functions can be used to implement compressors and
/// decompressors; e.g. Dynamic and Static Huffman encodings use variable length
/// bits sequences, while LZW (see <a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/LZW compression" title="LZW compression"></a>) use fixed or variable <span class="rosetta__text--italic">words</span>
/// nine (or more) bits long.
/// <br>
/// <ul class="rosetta__unordered-list">
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Limits in the maximum number of bits that can be written/read in a single read/write operation are allowed.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Errors handling is not mandatory</li>
