Bitmap/Histogram

{{task|Image processing}}

Extend the basic bitmap storage defined <a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Basic_bitmap_storage" title="Basic_bitmap_storage">on this page</a> to support dealing with image histograms. The image histogram contains for each luminance the count of image pixels having this luminance. Choosing a histogram representation take care about the data type used for the counts. It must have range of at least 0..NxM, where N is the image width and M is the image height.

Histogram is useful for many image processing operations. As an example, use it to convert an image into black and white art. The method works as follows:
* Convert image to grayscale;
* Compute the histogram
* Find the median: defined as the luminance such that the image has an approximately equal number of pixels with lesser and greater luminance.
* Replace each pixel of luminance lesser than the median to black, and others to white.
