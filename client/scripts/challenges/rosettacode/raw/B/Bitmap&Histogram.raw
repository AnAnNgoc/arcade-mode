/// Extend the basic bitmap storage defined <a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Basic_bitmap_storage" title="Basic_bitmap_storage">on this page</a> to support dealing with image histograms. The image histogram contains for each luminance the count of image pixels having this luminance. Choosing a histogram representation take care about the data type used for the counts. It must have range of at least 0..NxM, where N is the image width and M is the image height.

/// <span class="rosetta__text--bold">Test task</span>

/// Histogram is useful for many image processing operations. As an example, use it to convert an image into black and white art. The method works as follows:
/// <ul class="rosetta__unordered-list">
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Convert image to grayscale;</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Compute the histogram</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Find the median: defined as the luminance such that the image has an approximately equal number of pixels with lesser and greater luminance.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Replace each pixel of luminance lesser than the median to black, and others to white.</li>
/// <br>
/// </ul>Use <a class="rosetta__link--rosetta" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/read ppm file " title="read ppm file "> read]]/[[write ppm file]], and [[grayscale image</a> solutions.
