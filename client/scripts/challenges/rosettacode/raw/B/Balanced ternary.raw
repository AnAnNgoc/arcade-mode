Balanced ternary

{{task}}
<a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced ternary" title="wp: Balanced ternary">Balanced ternary</a> is a way of representing numbers.  Unlike the prevailing binary representation, a balanced ternary integer is in base 3, and each digit can have the values 1, 0, or −1.  For example, decimal 11 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>1</sup> − 3<sup>0</sup>, thus can be written as "++−", while 6 = 3<sup>2</sup> − 3<sup>1</sup> + 0 × 3<sup>0</sup>, i.e., "+−0".

For this task, implement balanced ternary representation of integers with the following

<span class="rosetta__text--bold">Requirements</span>
# Support arbitrarily large integers, both positive and negative;
# Provide ways to convert to and from text strings, using digits '+', '-' and '0' (unless you are already using strings to represent balanced ternary; but see requirement 5).
# Provide ways to convert to and from native integer type (unless, improbably, your platform's native integer type <span class="rosetta__text--italic">is</span> balanced ternary).  If your native integers can't support arbitrary length, overflows during conversion must be indicated.
# Provide ways to perform addition, negation and multiplication directly on balanced ternary integers; do <span class="rosetta__text--italic">not</span> convert to native integers first.
# Make your implementation efficient, with a reasonable definition of "efficient" (and with a reasonable definition of "reasonable").

<span class="rosetta__text--bold">Test case</span> With balanced ternaries <span class="rosetta__text--italic">a</span> from string "+-0++0+", <span class="rosetta__text--italic">b</span> from native integer -436, <span class="rosetta__text--italic">c</span> "+-++-":
* write out <span class="rosetta__text--italic">a</span>, <span class="rosetta__text--italic">b</span> and <span class="rosetta__text--italic">c</span> in decimal notation;
* calculate <span class="rosetta__text--italic">a</span> × (<span class="rosetta__text--italic">b</span> − <span class="rosetta__text--italic">c</span>), write out the result in both ternary and decimal notations.
