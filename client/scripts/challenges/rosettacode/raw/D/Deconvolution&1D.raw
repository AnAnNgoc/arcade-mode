Deconvolution/1D

{{task|Mathematical operations}}
The convolution of two functions $\mathit{F}$ and $\mathit{H}$ of
an integer variable is defined as the function $\mathit{G}$
satisfying

:$ G(n) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} F(m) H(n-m) $

for all integers $\mathit{n}$. Assume $F(n)$ can be non-zero only for $0$ &le; $\mathit{n}$ &le; $|\mathit{F}|$, where $|\mathit{F}|$ is the "length" of $\mathit{F}$, and similarly for $\mathit{G}$ and $\mathit{H}$, so that the functions can be modeled as finite sequences by identifying $f_0, f_1, f_2, \dots$ with $F(0), F(1), F(2), \dots$, etc. 
Then for example, values of $|\mathit{F}| = 6$ and $|\mathit{H}| = 5$ would determine the following value of $\mathit{g}$ by definition.

:$
\begin{array}{lllllllllll}
g_0 &= &f_0h_0\\
g_1 &= &f_1h_0 &+ &f_0h_1\\
g_2 &= &f_2h_0 &+ &f_1h_1 &+ &f_0h_2\\
g_3 &= &f_3h_0 &+ &f_2h_1 &+ &f_1h_2 &+ &f_0h_3\\
g_4 &= &f_4h_0 &+ &f_3h_1 &+ &f_2h_2 &+ &f_1h_3 &+ &f_0h_4\\
g_5 &= &f_5h_0 &+ &f_4h_1 &+ &f_3h_2 &+ &f_2h_3 &+ &f_1h_4\\
g_6 &= &       &  &f_5h_1 &+ &f_4h_2 &+ &f_3h_3 &+ &f_2h_4\\
g_7 &= &       &  &       &  &f_5h_2 &+ &f_4h_3 &+ &f_3h_4\\
g_8 &= &       &  &       &  &       &  &f_5h_3 &+ &f_4h_4\\
g_9 &= &       &  &       &  &       &  &       &  &f_5h_4
\end{array}
$

We can write this in matrix form as:

:$
\left( 
\begin{array}{l}
g_0 \\
g_1 \\
g_2 \\
g_3 \\
g_4 \\
g_5 \\
g_6 \\
g_7 \\
g_8 \\
g_9 \\
\end{array}
\right) = \left(
\begin{array}{lllll}
f_0\\
f_1 & f_0\\
f_2 & f_1 & f_0\\
f_3 & f_2 & f_1 & f_0\\
f_4 & f_3 & f_2 & f_1 & f_0\\
f_5 & f_4 & f_3 & f_2 & f_1\\
    & f_5 & f_4 & f_3 & f_2\\
    &     & f_5 & f_4 & f_3\\
    &     &     & f_5 & f_4\\
    &     &     &     & f_5
\end{array}
\right) \; \left(
\begin{array}{l}
h_0 \\
h_1 \\
h_2 \\
h_3 \\
h_4 \\
\end{array} \right)
$

or

:$
g = A \; h
$

For this task, implement a function (or method, procedure, subroutine, etc.) <code>deconv</code> to perform <span class="rosetta__text--italic">deconvolution</span> (i.e., the <span class="rosetta__text--italic">inverse</span> of convolution) by constructing and solving such a system of equations represented by the above matrix $A$ for $\mathit{h}$ given $\mathit{f}$ and $\mathit{g}$.

* The function should work for $\mathit{G}$ of arbitrary length (i.e., not hard coded or constant) and $\mathit{F}$ of any length up to that of $\mathit{G}$. Note that $|\mathit{H}|$ will be given by $|\mathit{G}| - |\mathit{F}| + 1$.
* There may be more equations than unknowns. If convenient, use a function from a [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/node27.html library] that finds the best fitting solution to an overdetermined system of linear equations (as in the [[Multiple regression]] task).  Otherwise, prune the set of equations as needed and solve as in the [[Reduced row echelon form]] task.
* Test your solution on the following data. Be sure to verify both that <code>deconv</code>$(g,f) = h$ and <code>deconv</code>$(g,h) = f$ and display the results in a human readable form.
<code>
h = [-8,-9,-3,-1,-6,7]<br>
f = [-3,-6,-1,8,-6,3,-1,-9,-9,3,-2,5,2,-2,-7,-1]<br>
g = [24,75,71,-34,3,22,-45,23,245,25,52,25,-67,-96,96,31,55,36,29,-43,-7]
