Digital root/Multiplicative digital root

{{task|Mathematics}}

The <a class="rosetta__link--wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative digital root" title="wp: Multiplicative digital root">multiplicative digital root]] (MDR) and multiplicative persistence (MP) of a number, $n$, is calculated rather like the [[Digital root</a> except digits are multiplied instead of being added:
# Set $m$ to $n$ and $i$ to $0$.
# While $m$ has more than one digit:
#* Find a replacement $m$ as the multiplication of the digits of the current value of $m$.
#* Increment $i$.
# Return $i$ (= MP) and $m$ (= MDR)


;Task:
* Tabulate the MP and MDR of the numbers 123321, 7739, 893, 899998
* Tabulate MDR versus the first five numbers having that MDR, something like:
<pre>
MDR: [n0..n4]
===  ========
  0: [0, 10, 20, 25, 30]
  1: [1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111]
  2: [2, 12, 21, 26, 34]
  3: [3, 13, 31, 113, 131]
  4: [4, 14, 22, 27, 39]
  5: [5, 15, 35, 51, 53]
  6: [6, 16, 23, 28, 32]
  7: [7, 17, 71, 117, 171]
  8: [8, 18, 24, 29, 36]
  9: [9, 19, 33, 91, 119]
