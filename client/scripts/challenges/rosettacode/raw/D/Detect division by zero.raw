;Task:
Write a function to detect a &nbsp; <span class="rosetta__text--italic">divide by zero error</span> &nbsp; without checking if the denominator is zero.
<br><br>

JavaScript does not give an error on division by 0, and this is more useful than it is Mathematically correct.  However, 0 divided by 0 will yield NaN, which is actually correct, since 0/0 is defined as "indeterminate".  It may be better to return 0 or false in these situations, though, depending on the application  (in JavaScript, 0 and false are the same thing):
<lang JavaScript>function divByZero(dividend,divisor)
{
	var quotient=dividend/divisor;
        if(isNaN(quotient)) return 0; //Can be changed to whatever is desired by the programmer to be 0, false, or Infinity
        return quotient; //Will return Infinity or -Infinity in cases of, for example, 5/0 or -7/0 respectively
}
alert(divByZero(0,0));</lang>
This will output "0" instead of "NaN". In this case, when checking against for true, the condition needs to be explicit ("===" rather than "==") because if divByZero(5,5) is used, this will return 1, which is the same as true when using "==".
