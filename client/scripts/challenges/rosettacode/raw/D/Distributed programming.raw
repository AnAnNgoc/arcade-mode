Distributed programming

{{task|Networking and Web Interaction}}

Write two programs (or one program with two modes) which run on networked computers, and send some messages between them.

The protocol used may be language-specific or not, and should be <span class="rosetta__text--bold">suitable for general distributed programming</span>; that is, the <span class="rosetta__text--italic">protocol</span> should be generic (not designed just for the particular example application), readily capable of handling the independent communications of many different components of a single application, and the transferring of arbitrary data structures natural for the language.

This task is intended to demonstrate high-level communication facilities beyond just creating [[sockets]].

===Server===

<lang javascript>var net = require('net')

var server = net.createServer(function (c){
  c.write('hello\r\n')
  c.pipe(c) // echo messages back
})

server.listen(3000, 'localhost')
</lang>

===Client===
<lang javascript>var net = require('net')

conn = net.createConnection(3000, '192.168.1.x')

conn.on('connect', function(){
	console.log('connected')
	conn.write('test')
})

conn.on('data', function(msg){
	console.log(msg.toString())
})</lang>
