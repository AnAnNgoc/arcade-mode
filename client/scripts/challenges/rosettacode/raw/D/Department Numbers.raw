/// There is a highly organized city that has decided to assign a number to each of their departments:
/// <span class="rosetta__text--indented">:* &nbsp; police department</span>
/// <span class="rosetta__text--indented">:* &nbsp; sanitation department</span>
/// <span class="rosetta__text--indented">:* &nbsp; fire department </span>
/// <br>
/// <br>
/// Each department can have a number between <span class="rosetta__text--bold">1</span> and <span class="rosetta__text--bold">7</span> &nbsp; (inclusive).
/// <br>
/// The three department numbers are to be unique (different from each other) and must add up to the number <span class="rosetta__text--bold">12</span>.
/// <br>
/// The Chief of the Police doesn't like odd numbers and wants to have an even number for his department.
