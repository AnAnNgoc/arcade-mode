/// description:
/// Implement a 2D sliding block puzzle game where blocks with numbers are combined to add their values.
/// <br>
/// The rules are that each turn the player must perform a valid move shifting all tiles in one direction (up, down, left or right). A move is valid when at least one tile can be moved in that direction. When moved against each other tiles with the same number on them combine into one. A new tile with the value of 2 is spawned at the end of each turn if there is an empty spot for it. To win the player must create a tile with the number 2048. The player loses if no valid moves are possible.
/// <br>
/// The name comes from the popular open-source implementation of this game mechanic, [https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ 2048].
/// <br>
/// Requirements:
/// <ul class="rosetta__unordered-list"><li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">"Non-greedy" movement. The tiles that were created by combining other tiles should not be combined again during the same turn (move). That is to say that moving the tile row of</li></ul>
///   [2][2][2][2]
/// <br>
/// to the right should result in 
/// <br>
///   ......[4][4]
/// <br>
/// and not
/// <br>
///   .........[8]
/// <br>
/// <ul class="rosetta__unordered-list"><li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">"Move direction priority". If more than one variant of combining is possible, move direction shows one that will take effect. For example, moving the tile row of</li></ul>
///   ...[2][2][2]
/// <br>
/// to the right should result in
/// <br>
///   ......[2][4]
/// <br>
/// and not
/// <br>
///   ......[4][2]
/// <br>
/// <ul class="rosetta__unordered-list"><li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Adding a new tile on a blank space. Most of the time new "2" is to be added and occasionally (10% of the time) - "4"</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Check for valid moves. The player shouldn't be able to skip their turn by trying a move that doesn't change the board.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Win condition.</li>
/// <li class="rosetta__list-item--unordered">Lose condition.</li></ul>
