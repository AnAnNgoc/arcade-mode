 <p class="rosetta__paragraph">Five sailors are shipwrecked on an island and
 collect a large pile of coconuts during the day.
 </p>

 <p class="rosetta__paragraph">That night the first sailor wakes up and decides
   to take his first share early  so tries to divide the pile of coconuts equally
   into five piles but finds that there is one coconut left over, so he tosses it
   to a monkey and then hides "his" one of the five equally sized piles of
   coconuts and pushes the other four piles together to form a single visible pile
   of coconuts again and goes to bed.
 </p>

 <br/>

 <p class="rosetta__paragraph">
   To cut a long story short, each of the sailors in
   turn gets up once during the night and performs the same actions of dividing
   the coconut pile into five, finding that one coconut is left over and giving
   that single remainder coconut to the monkey.
 </p>

 <br/>

 <p class="rosetta__paragraph">
   In the morning (after the surreptitious and
   separate action of each of the five sailors during the night), the remaining
   coconuts are divided into five equal piles for each of the sailors, whereupon
   it is found that the pile of coconuts divides equally amongst the sailors with
   no remainder. (Nothing for the monkey in the morning.)
