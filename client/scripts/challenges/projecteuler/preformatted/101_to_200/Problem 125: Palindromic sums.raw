/// description:
/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: 62 + 72 + 82 + 92 + 102 + 112 + 122.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that 1 = 02 + 12 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Find the sum of all the numbers less than 108 that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.</p></div>
