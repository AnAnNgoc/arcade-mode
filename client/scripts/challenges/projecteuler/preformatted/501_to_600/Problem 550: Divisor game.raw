/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">Two players are playing a game. There are k piles of stones.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">When it is his turn a player has to choose a pile and replace it by two piles of stones under the following two conditions:</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"> Both new piles must have a number of stones more than one and less than the number of stones of the original pile.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"> The number of stones of each of the new piles must be a divisor of the number of stones of the original pile.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">The first player unable to make a valid move loses.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Let f(n,k) be the number of winning positions for the first player, assuming perfect play, when the game is played with k piles each having between 2 and n stones (inclusively).f(10,5)=40085.</p>
