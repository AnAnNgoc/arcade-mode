/// title: Problem 256: Tatami-Free Rooms
/// type: project-euler

/// categories:
/// math

/// difficulty: ?

/// benchmark:
//replaceWithActualFunctionHere;

/// description:
/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions a, b and even size s = a·b.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition a ≤ b.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red "X" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">The smallest tatami-free room has size s = 70 and dimensions 7×10.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">All the other rooms of size s = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Hence, T(70) = 1.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Similarly, we can verify that T(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size s = 1320:</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">In fact, s = 1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 5.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 200.</p></div>
