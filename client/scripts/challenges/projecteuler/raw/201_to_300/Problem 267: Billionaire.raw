You then bet £0.375 and if the second toss is tails, you have £1.125.</p><p class="euler__paragraph">Choosing f to maximize your chances of having at least £1,000,000,000 after 1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a billionaire?</p><p class="euler__paragraph">All computations are assumed to be exact (no rounding), but give your answer rounded to 12 digits behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghijkl.</p></div>
