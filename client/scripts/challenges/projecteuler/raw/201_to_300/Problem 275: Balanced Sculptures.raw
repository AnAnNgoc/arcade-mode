/// description:
/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">Let us define a balanced sculpture of order n as follows:</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">A polyomino made up of n+1 tiles known as the blocks (n tiles) and the plinth (remaining tile);</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">the plinth has its centre at position (x = 0, y = 0);</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">the blocks have y-coordinates greater than zero (so the plinth is the unique lowest tile);</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">the centre of mass of all the blocks, combined, has x-coordinate equal to zero.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">When counting the sculptures, any arrangements which are simply reflections about the y-axis, are not counted as distinct. For example, the 18 balanced sculptures of order 6 are shown below; note that each pair of mirror images (about the y-axis) is counted as one sculpture:</p>

/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">There are 964 balanced sculptures of order 10 and 360505 of order 15.How many balanced sculptures are there of order 18?</p></div>
