/// description:
/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH. </p><p class="euler__paragraph">For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2n distinct proteins consisting of n elements.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous.</p><p class="euler__paragraph">As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside.</p><p class="euler__paragraph">Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in two dimensions.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally.</p><p class="euler__paragraph">On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be 850 / 28=3.3203125.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 15?</p><p class="euler__paragraph">Give your answer using as many decimal places as necessary for an exact result.</p></div>
