/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">"The Chase" is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; if he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise, he keeps the die for the next turn.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled and passed; that player has then lost.</p>

/// <p class="euler__paragraph">In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game lasts?</p>
