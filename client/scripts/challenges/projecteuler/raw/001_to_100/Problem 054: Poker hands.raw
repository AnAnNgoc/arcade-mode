But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.</p><p class="euler__paragraph">Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">Hand Player 1 Player 2 Winner</p><p class="euler__paragraph">1 5H 5C 6S 7S KDPair of Fives 2C 3S 8S 8D TDPair of Eights Player 2</p><p class="euler__paragraph">2 5D 8C 9S JS ACHighest card Ace 2C 5C 7D 8S QHHighest card Queen Player 1</p><p class="euler__paragraph">3 2D 9C AS AH ACThree Aces 3D 6D 7D TD QDFlush  with Diamonds Player 2</p><p class="euler__paragraph">4 4D 6S 9H QH QCPair of QueensHighest card Nine 3D 6D 7H QD QSPair of QueensHighest card Seven Player 1</p><p class="euler__paragraph">5 2H 2D 4C 4D 4SFull HouseWith Three Fours 3C 3D 3S 9S 9DFull Housewith Three Threes Player 1</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">The file, poker.txt, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards.
