/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions. </p><p class="euler__paragraph">Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers: "Your guess is lower than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of a), or</p><p class="euler__paragraph"> "Your guess is higher than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of b), or</p><p class="euler__paragraph"> "Yes, that's it!" (and the game ends).</p><p class="euler__paragraph">Given the value of n, a, and b, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost for the worst possible case.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">For example, if n = 5, a = 2, and b = 3, then we may begin by asking "2" as our first question.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that "1" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 3).</p><p class="euler__paragraph">If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then our next question will be "4".</p><p class="euler__paragraph">If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that "3" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=5).</p><p class="euler__paragraph">If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then we are sure that "5" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=4).</p><p class="euler__paragraph">Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. </p><p class="euler__paragraph">So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of n, a, and b.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">Let C(n, a, b) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of n, a, and b.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">Here are a few examples:</p><p class="euler__paragraph">C(5, 2, 3) = 5</p><p class="euler__paragraph">C(500, √2, √3) = 13.22073197...</p><p class="euler__paragraph">C(20000, 5, 7) = 82</p><p class="euler__paragraph">C(2000000, √5, √7) = 49.63755955...</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">Let Fk be the Fibonacci numbers: Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 with base cases F1 = F2 = 1.Find ∑1≤k≤30 C(1012, √k, √Fk), and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p></div>
