/// description:
/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">There are several ways to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using distinct integers.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">For instance, the numbers {2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35} can be used:</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">In fact, only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive, there are exactly three ways to do it, the remaining two being: {2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45} and {2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}.</p>
