/// description:
<div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">A best approximation to a real number x for the denominator bound d is a rational number r/s (in reduced form) with s â‰¤ d, so that any rational number p/q which is closer to x than r/s has q > d.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. 9/40 has the two best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator bound 6.</p><p class="euler__paragraph">We shall call a real number x ambiguous, if there is at least one denominator bound for which x possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.</p><p class="euler__paragraph"></p><p class="euler__paragraph">How many ambiguous numbers x = p/q,</p><p class="euler__paragraph">0 < x < 1/100, are there whose denominator q does not exceed 108?</p></div>
