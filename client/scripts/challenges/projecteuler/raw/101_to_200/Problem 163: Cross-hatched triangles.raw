Using size 1 triangles as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the size 2 triangle in the above sketch.

A size 3 triangle would contain 9 size 1 triangle building blocks and a size n triangle would thus contain n2 size 1 triangle building blocks.</p><p class="euler__paragraph">If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of size n, then</p><p class="euler__paragraph">T(1) = 16</p><p class="euler__paragraph">T(2) = 104</p><p class="euler__paragraph">Find T(36).</p></div>
