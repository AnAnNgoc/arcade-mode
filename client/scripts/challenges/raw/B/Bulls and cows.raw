Bulls and cows

[[wp:Bulls and Cows|Bulls and Cows]] &nbsp; is an old game played with pencil and paper that was later implemented using computers.


;Task:
Create a four digit random number from the digits &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; to &nbsp; '''9''', &nbsp; without duplication.

The program should: 
::::::* &nbsp; ask for guesses to this number
::::::* &nbsp; reject guesses that are malformed
::::::* &nbsp; print the score for the guess


The score is computed as:
# The player wins if the guess is the same as the randomly chosen number, and the program ends.
# A score of one '''bull''' is accumulated for each digit in the guess that equals the corresponding digit in the randomly chosen initial number.
# A score of one '''cow''' is accumulated for each digit in the guess that also appears in the randomly chosen number, but in the wrong position.

Example game (cheating!):

 Bulls and Cows Game
 -------------------
   You must guess the 4 digit number I am thinking of.
   The number is composed of the digits 1-9.
   No digit appears more than once.
   After each of your guesses, I will tell you:
     The number of bulls (digits in right place)
     The number of cows (correct digits, but in wrong place)
 
 Your guess #1: 1234
     Bulls: 0, cows: 2
 Your guess #2: 5678
     Bulls: 1, cows: 1
 Your guess #3: 3167
     Bulls: 0, cows: 3
 Your guess #4: 9123
     Bulls: 1, cows: 1
 Your guess #5: 5137
     Bulls: 1, cows: 3
 Your guess #6: 5317
     Bulls: 2, cows: 2
 Your guess #7: 5731
     Bulls: 2, cows: 2
 Your guess #8: 5713
     Bulls: 4, cows: 0
 You win! Guesses needed: 8
