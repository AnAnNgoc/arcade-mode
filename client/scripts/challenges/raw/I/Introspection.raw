Introspection

{{task|Programming environment operations}}

;Task:
* verify the version/revision of your currently running (compiler/interpreter/byte-compiler/runtime environment/whatever your language uses) and exit if it is too old.
* check whether the variable "bloop" exists and whether the math-function "abs()" is available and if yes compute <i>abs(bloop)</i>.


;Extra credit:
* Report the number of integer variables in global scope, and their sum.

=={{header|JavaScript}}==

It is generally out of favor to explicitly test versions in JavaScript, due to the immense variety of implementations; instead, one should use “feature testing”, executing code to check for the desired behavior. Checking for “abs” as in this task is an example of feature testing.

Testing whether the variable “bloop” exists:

<lang javascript>if (typeof bloop !== "undefined") { ... }</lang>

The <code>typeof</code> operator explicitly does not throw an error when given an undeclared variable.

Test whether <code>Math.abs()</code> is available:

<lang javascript>if ("abs" in Math) { ... }</lang>

<code>abs</code> is a method of the Math object, methods are properties, and the <code>in</code> operator tests whether an object has the named property.
