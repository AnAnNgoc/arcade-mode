Trigonometric functions

{{task|Arithmetic operations}} 
[[Category:Mathematics]]

;Task:
If your language has a library or built-in functions for trigonometry, show examples of:
::* &nbsp; sine
::* &nbsp; cosine
::* &nbsp; tangent
::* &nbsp; inverses &nbsp; (of the above)
<br>using the same angle in radians and degrees. 

For the non-inverse functions, &nbsp; each radian/degree pair should use arguments that evaluate to the same angle &nbsp; (that is, it's not necessary to use the same angle for all three regular functions as long as the two sine calls use the same angle). 

For the inverse functions, &nbsp; use the same number and convert its answer to radians and degrees. 

If your language does not have trigonometric functions available or only has some available, &nbsp; write functions to calculate the functions based on any &nbsp; [[wp:List of trigonometric identities|known approximation or identity]].

=={{header|JavaScript}}==

JavaScript's <tt>Math</tt> class contains all six functions and is automatically included as part of the language. The functions all accept radians only, so conversion is necessary when dealing with degrees. The <tt>Math</tt> class also has a <tt>PI</tt> constant for easy conversion. 

<lang javascript>var
 radians = Math.PI / 4, // Pi / 4 is 45 degrees. All answers should be the same.
 degrees = 45.0,
 sine = Math.sin(radians),
 cosine = Math.cos(radians),
 tangent = Math.tan(radians),
 arcsin = Math.asin(sine),
 arccos = Math.acos(cosine),
 arctan = Math.atan(tangent);

// sine
window.alert(sine + " " + Math.sin(degrees * Math.PI / 180));
// cosine
window.alert(cosine + " " + Math.cos(degrees * Math.PI / 180));
// tangent
window.alert(tangent + " " + Math.tan(degrees * Math.PI / 180));
// arcsine
window.alert(arcsin + " " + (arcsin * 180 / Math.PI));
// arccosine
window.alert(arccos + " " + (arccos * 180 / Math.PI));
// arctangent
window.alert(arctan + " " + (arctan * 180 / Math.PI));</lang>
