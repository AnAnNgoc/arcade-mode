Guess the number/With feedback (player)

{{task|Games}}
The task is to write a player for the game that follows the following rules:
:The scorer will choose a number between set limits. The computer player will print a guess of the target number. The computer asks for a score of whether its guess is higher than, lower than, or equal to the target. The computer guesses, and the scorer scores, in turn, until the computer correctly guesses the target number.

The computer should guess intelligently based on the accumulated scores given. One way is to use a [[Binary search]] based algorithm.

A boring solution that does nothing clever or inscrutable.

Well, it does use recursion for the guessing function, but that's OK because the depth is bounded by LOG<sub>2</sub> of the range. That's not true if the user changes his number, but then he gets what he deserves.

<lang javascript>#!/usr/bin/env js

var DONE = RIGHT = 0, HIGH = 1, LOW = -1;

function main() {
    showInstructions();
    while (guess(1, 100) !== DONE);
}

function guess(low, high) {
    if (low > high) {
        print("I can't guess it. Perhaps you changed your number.");
        return DONE;
    }
    
    var g = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    var result = getResult(g);
    switch (result) {
        case RIGHT:
            return DONE;
        case LOW:
            return guess(g + 1, high);
        case HIGH:
            return guess(low, g - 1);
    }
}

function getResult(g) {
    while(true) {
        putstr('Is it ' + g + '? ');
        var ans = readline().toUpperCase().replace(/^\s+/, '') + ' ';
        switch (ans[0]) {
            case 'R':
                print('I got it! Thanks for the game.');
                return RIGHT;
            case 'L': 
                return LOW;
            case 'H':
                return HIGH;
            default:
                print('Please tell me if I am "high", "low" or "right".');
        }
    }
}

function showInstructions() {
    print('Think of a number between 1 and 100 and I will try to guess it.');
    print('After I guess, type "low", "high" or "right", and then press enter.');
    putstr("When you've thought of a number press enter.");
    readline();
}

main();
</lang>

An example session:
 Think of a number between 1 and 100 and I will try to guess it.
 After I guess, type "low", "high" or "right", and then press enter.
 When you've thought of a number press enter.
 Is it 50? high
 Is it 25? high
 Is it 12? low
 Is it 18? high
 Is it 15? high
 Is it 13? right
 I got it! Thanks for the game.

Another example session:
 Think of a number between 1 and 100 and I will try to guess it.
 After I guess, type "low", "high" or "right", and then press enter.
 When you've thought of a number press enter.
 Is it 50? n
 Please tell me if I am "high", "low" or "right".
 Is it 50? h
 Is it 25? h
 Is it 12? h
 Is it 6? h
 Is it 3? h
 Is it 1? h
 I can't guess it. Perhaps you changed your number.
