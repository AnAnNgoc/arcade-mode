HTTPS

{{task|Programming environment operations}}
[[Category:Networking and Web Interaction]]

;Task:
Print an HTTPS URL's content to the console. Checking the host certificate for validity is recommended. 

The client should not authenticate itself to the server — the webpage https://sourceforge.net/ supports that access policy — as that is the subject of other [[HTTPS request with authentication|tasks]].

Readers may wish to contrast with the [[HTTP Request]] task, and also the task on [[HTTPS request with authentication]].

<lang JavaScript>
(function(url,callback){//on some browsers you can check certificate information.
xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET',url,true);
xhr.onreadystatechange=function(){if(xhr.readyState==xhr.DONE){callback(xhr)}};
xhr.send();
})('https://sourceforge.net',function(xhr){console.log(xhr.response)})
