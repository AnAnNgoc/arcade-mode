Associative array/Iteration

{{task|Basic language learning}}[[Category:Iteration]][[Category:Data Structures]]
Show how to iterate over the key-value pairs of an associative array, and print each pair out. 

Also show how to iterate just over the keys, or the values, if there is a separate way to do that in your language.

=={{header|JavaScript}}==
JavaScript does not have associative arrays until ECMAScript 6 brings Maps. In versions up to ES5.1, you may add properties to an empty object to achieve the same effect.
<lang javascript>var myhash = {}; //a new, empty object
myhash["hello"] = 3;
myhash.world = 6; //obj.name is equivalent to obj["name"] for certain values of name
myhash["!"] = 9;

//iterate using for..in loop
for (var key in myhash) {
  //ensure key is in object and not in prototype
  if (myhash.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log("Key is: " + key + '. Value is: ' + myhash[key]);
  }
}

//iterate using ES5.1 Object.keys() and Array.prototype.Map()
var keys = Object.keys(); //get Array of object keys (doesn't get prototype keys)
keys.map(function (key) {
  console.log("Key is: " + key + '. Value is: ' + myhash[key]);
});</lang>
