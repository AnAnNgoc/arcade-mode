Set

{{task|Discrete math}}
{{data structure}}
A &nbsp; '''set''' &nbsp;is a collection of elements, without duplicates and without order.


;Task:
Show each of these set operations:

* Set creation
* Test m &isin; S -- "m is an element in set S"
* A &cup; B -- ''union''; a set of all elements either in set A or in set B.
* A &cap; B -- ''intersection''; a set of all elements in ''both'' set A and set B.
* A &#x2216; B -- ''difference''; a set of all elements in set A, except those in set B.
* A &sube; B -- ''subset''; true if every element in set A is also in set B.
* A = B -- ''equality''; true if every element of set A is in set B and vice versa.

<br>
As an option, show some other set operations.
<br>(If A &sube; B, but A &ne; B, then A is called a true or proper subset of B, written A &sub; B or A &#x228a; B.) 

As another option, show how to modify a mutable set.


One might implement a set using an [[associative array]] (with set elements as array keys and some dummy value as the values). 

One might also implement a set with a binary search tree, or with a hash table, or with an ordered array of binary bits (operated on with bit-wise binary operators). 

The basic test, m &isin; S, is [[O]](n) with a sequential list of elements, O(''log'' n) with a balanced binary search tree, or (O(1) average-case, O(n) worst case) with a hash table.

=={{header|JavaScript}}==
JavaScript does not support native sets before ECMAScript 6. 

<lang javascript>
var set = new Set();

set.add(0);
set.add(1);
set.add('two');
set.add('three');

set.has(0); //=> true
set.has(3); //=> false
set.has('two'); // true
set.has(Math.sqrt(4)); //=> false
set.has('TWO'.toLowerCase()); //=> true

set.size; //=> 4

set.delete('two');
set.has('two'); //==> false
set.size; //=> 3

//iterating set using ES6 for..of
//Set order is preserved in order items are added.
for (var item of set) {
  console.log('item is ' + item);
}</lang>
